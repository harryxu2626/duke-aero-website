        Designed during the 2018/19 academic year for a low altitude flight at
        the Bayboro Launch Facility in NC, Bluestone marked a significant
        milestone for Duke AERO in its design and fabrication. Up until
        Bluestone we had established a history of constructing small low-powered
        rockets, a trend which Bluestone shattered. At a length of over 9 feet
        and a weight close to 90 pounds, Bluestone blew through our highest
        expectations in altitude, speed, and stability. However, with every
        great advancement comes a setback and loss of avionics tracking near
        apogee led to an inability to recover the rocket. A drastic step up in
        power and performance, Bluestone marked Duke AEROâ€™s first rocket with
        established goals and success criteria, and paved the way for our future
        projects with bigger, heavier, and more powerful vehicles.
